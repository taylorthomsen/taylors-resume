				<p class='welcome'>My resume is attached for you to take a look at.
					I am currently a software developer working with an innovation lab
					for a global insurance company. As Chrissy said, I have been working
					remotely and am looking for a new role in the DC, Arlington, or
					surrounding area. I enjoy my development work, but am looking to have
					an office as home base again. I have been looking at mainly data
					science and software development roles and am open to anything
					related. I recently finished my masters degree in government
					analytics and would love to work for an organization that is working
					on government or policy issues. From what Iâ€™ve read, it looks like
					the Hub could be right up my alley.
