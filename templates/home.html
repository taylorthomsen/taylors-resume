		<p>The relationship between Second Amendment Rights and gun control has proven to be a difficult one throughout history and increasingly in current events. While a convincing argument can be made for allowing people the freedom to own and operate firearms, an argument can also be made for controlling firearm access in the interest of public safety. Some will argue that active shooter tragedies have less to do with the availability of firearms and more to do with the humans who operate the firearms. One thing that is for certain is that it is essential to consult the data when discussing such an important topic. I am interested in identifying whether gun ownership rates are related to acts of violence within a country.</p>
